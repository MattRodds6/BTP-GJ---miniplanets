# BTP-GJ---miniplanets
This was a project created for Blacktropod's gameJam 2. The theme of the gamejam was miniplanets. This game was created in gamemaker studio 2 using gamemaker language.
I utilized realworld physics and my knowledge on gravity to create a game with basic physics based movement. The player character was weighed down by a small planet's 
gravitational pull to allow the player to walk around in the miniature planet. Then the palyer would be able to jump from planet to planet using gravity to speed up
and escape a planets gravitational pull and move through out space to fight alien flies. I got most of the movement working however had troubles trying to create an 
enemy ai that could work around the gravitational pull of the planets.
